## Who We Are

**Factory Weights** makes purchasing high-quality gym and fitness equipment **convenient, affordable, and fast**. With **next-day delivery**, you can purchase today and train tomorrow.

## Our Story

Established in **2021**, Factory Weights was founded in response to the scarcity and rapidly increasing prices of gym and fitness equipment during the UK lockdown.

We believe that:

- Fitness is essential to a happier, healthier life
- High-quality gym equipment should be accessible to everyone
- Customers should not have to pay inflated prices to train effectively

By delivering equipment **directly from our factory to your door**, we eliminate unnecessary middle costs—allowing us to offer **premium gym equipment at the lowest possible prices**.
